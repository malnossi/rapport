        \lettrine[findent=2pt]{{\textbf{T}}}{ }he era of maintenance is long gone. And structured maintenance in the service sector is now a must. This cannot be done easily without a CMMS that can be parameterized as standard and adapted to the functional flows of each organization. The maintenance of automatic analyzers and associated documentation taking part in the requirements of the ISO 15189 Standard and the French regulation as well have to be defined in the laboratory policy. The management of the periodic maintenance and documentation shall be implemented and fulfilled. The organization of corrective maintenance has to be managed to avoid interruption of the task of the laboratory. The different recommendations concern the identification of materials including automatic analyzers, the environmental conditions to take into account, the documentation provided by the manufacturer and documents prepared by the laboratory including procedures for maintenance.
